# Hi Seb!

I made this site pretty quickly. This uses a built-in theme that Github lets you use, but don't have to use the same theme.

## FAQ

### Is this free?

Yep!

### How do I do this?

You should start by making an account at github.com, then head over to https://pages.github.com/ to see some instructions.

### Did you have to do any styling?

I did not. I just typed some things into this template that they start you with.
